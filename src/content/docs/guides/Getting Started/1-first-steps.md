Welcome to PohjoisMail! We understand that getting started with a new email service can be overwhelming, but fear not – we're here to guide you through the process.

## Step 1: Sign Up

The first step is to sign up for PohjoisMail. You can easily do this by visiting our [signup page](/signup) and providing your personal email or phone number. You'll need to verify your email or phone number to complete the sign-up process.

## Step 2: Create an Organization

Once you're signed up, you'll be prompted to create an organization. An organization serves as the central hub where your domain, users, addresses, and other settings are stored. Whether you're a company or a group of individuals, each entity should have its own organization.

When creating your organization, simply choose a name that represents your entity. This name will be visible to everyone you grant access to your organization. Additionally, estimate the number of accounts your organization will require, reflecting the size of your company or group.

After providing these details, click on 'Create Organization' to proceed.

## Step 3: Add a Domain

With your organization set up, it's time to add a domain. Your domain is the unique address associated with your organization, appearing after the @ symbol in your email addresses.

If you don't already have a domain, don't worry – we can provide one for free as long as you subscribe to the Essential plan or higher.

For detailed instructions on adding a domain, refer to [this guide](/guides/adding-a-domain).

## Step 4: Purchase a Plan

Now that you've added your domain, it's essential to select a suitable plan. While we offer a free plan for testing purposes, we recommend opting for a paid plan if you're a company or a group of individuals. Explore our pricing and plans [here](/pricing).
