## What is a Group?
A group in PohjoisMail connects to an address, and any emails sent to that address are automatically forwarded to all members of the group. This includes both internal and external email addresses.

## What can I do with a Group?
Groups offer versatile functionality to meet various organizational needs. Here are some examples of how you can leverage groups:
- **Internal Communication**: Establish groups for different departments or teams within your organization to enhance internal communication, such as marketing, sales, or IT teams.
- **External Communication**: Organize groups for different customer segments or subscriber lists to streamline external communication, such as support, sales, or press contacts.
- **Project Collaboration**: Create groups dedicated to specific projects or initiatives to foster collaboration and streamline communication among project members.

## So, it's Like a Mailing List?
The functionality of a group in PohjoisMail resembles that of a mailing list in certain contexts. In PohjoisMail, a mailing list is a specialized type of group designed for bulk email communication with customers or subscribers. However, in other email systems, what we refer to as a group may be equivalent to what you consider a mailing list.

## How do I create a Group?
Creating a group is a straightforward process. Navigate to the Groups section of your organization's dashboard and click the "New Group" button. You'll then be prompted to provide a descriptive name for your group, reflecting its purpose.

Next, you'll need to associate an address with the group. If you already have an existing address, you can select "Use an existing address" and choose the desired one. Alternatively, if you need a new address, select "Create a new address" and assign an appropriate name. Consistent naming conventions for addresses, such as "marketing@yourorg.com" or "it-helpdesk@yourorg.com", promote clarity and efficient email management.

## How do I add members to a Group?
Adding members to a group is a simple process. Navigate to the desired group and click the "Add Member" button. Then, enter the email addresses of the members you wish to add, including both internal and external contacts.
